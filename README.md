# 🎮 Ping Pong Game – Final OOP Project

Created using **Processing** as the final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course.

## 📌 Description

This project is a classic **Ping Pong game** implemented using the object-oriented programming paradigm in Processing. The game challenges players to control a paddle and keep the ball bouncing for as long as possible while aiming for the highest score.

## 🎯 Key Features

* Paddle control using keyboard (← and → keys)
* Ball and paddle collision detection
* Gradual increase in ball speed
* Real-time score display
* Modular design using OOP (with classes for ball and paddle)

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented

* **Class & Object**: Each game entity (ball, paddle) is represented as an object.
* **Encapsulation**: Variables and functions are encapsulated within classes with limited access.
* **Abstraction**: Game logic is separated from UI implementation details.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Processing IDE** installed: [https://processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download)
2. Open this project folder in Processing.
3. Run `PingPong.pde` or the main file by clicking the **Play** button.
